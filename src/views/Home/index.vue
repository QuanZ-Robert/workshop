      <h1>Scope</h1>
      <div class="cente-text mg-bottom">
        Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have recently shown tremendous potential in various natural language
        processing tasks, such as language generation, machine translation, and question answering. In the financial
        services industry, pretrained LLMs could have a significant impact on tasks such as financial forecasting, risk
        management, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, LLMs can help automate the process of analyzing financial
        reports and extracting key insights that can help businesses make informed decisions.<br /><br />
        This workshop will provide a platform to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts from
        around the world to share new ideas, exchange research findings, and discuss the challenges and opportunities in
        the field. The workshop will cover two themes: 1) potential applications and best practices of pretrained LLMs
        for financial services; and 2) challenges that need to be addressed to make them efficient, effective and
        trustworthy. <br /><br />The workshop will also include invited talks by leading researchers and industry
        experts, as well as panel discussions on the latest trends and challenges in the field. We welcome researchers,
        practitioners, and industry experts from academia and industry to submit their work and participate in this
        exciting event.
